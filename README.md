# Bioinformatics-based Discovery of Sex-related Bladder Cancer Biomarkers 

## IMPORTANT NOTE: The TCGA data was too large to be uploaded to GitHub. In the "raw_data" directory, there needs to be a "TCGA" directory with "TCGA Control" and "TCGA Tumor" subdirectories. The control and tumor sample RNA-seq counts from TCGA-BLCA can be downloaded as TSVs from the genomic data commons and placed in the appropriate directories. The sample sheets are available in the main directory as "tumor_sample_sheet.tsv" and "control_sample_sheet.tsv."
